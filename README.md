# RAG++

> Content is taken from the official wandb repo at `https://github.com/wandb/edu/blob/main/rag-advanced`. All credits to them. This is my repo for following the course for educational purposes. I have put all the code in the `.ipynb` notebooks themselves - so my code might look ugly!

This repository contains the code for the [Advanced RAG course](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/rag-in-production).
